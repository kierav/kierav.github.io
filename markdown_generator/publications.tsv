2021-01-13	Fast Variable Density 3-D Node Generation	SIAM J. Sci. Comput.	Mesh-free solvers for partial differential equations perform best on scattered quasi-uniform nodes. Computational efficiency can be improved by using nodes with greater spacing in regions of less activity. However, there is no ideal way to generate nodes for these solvers. We present an advancing front type method to generate variable density nodes in 2-D and 3-D with clear generalization to higher dimensions. The exhibited cost of generating a node set of size N in 2-D and 3-D with the present method is O(N)	van der Sande, K. and Fornberg, B.

2021-10-06	Dynamic soliton-mean flow interaction with nonconvex flux	Journal of Fluid Mechanics	"The interaction of localised solitary waves with large-scale, time-varying dispersive mean
flows subject to non-convex flux is studied in the framework of the modified Korteweg–de
Vries (mKdV) equation, a canonical model for internal gravity wave propagation and
potential vorticity fronts in stratified fluids. The effect of large amplitude, dynamically
evolving mean flows on the propagation of localised waves – essentially ‘soliton steering’
by the mean flow – is considered. A recent theoretical and experimental study of this
new type of dynamic soliton–mean flow interaction for convex flux has revealed two
scenarios where the soliton either transmits through the varying mean flow or remains
trapped inside it. In this paper, it is demonstrated that the presence of a non-convex cubic
hydrodynamic flux introduces significant modifications to the scenarios for transmission
and trapping. A reduced set of Whitham modulation equations is used to formulate
a general mathematical framework for soliton–mean flow interaction with non-convex
flux. Solitary wave trapping is stated in terms of crossing modulation characteristics. Numerical simulations of the mKdV equation agree with modulation theory predictions.
The mathematical framework developed is general, not restricted to completely integrable
equations like mKdV, enabling application beyond the mKdV setting to other fluid
dynamic contexts subject to non-convex flux such as strongly nonlinear internal wave
propagation that is prevalent in the ocean."	van der Sande, K. and El, G. A. and Hoefer, A. (2021). “Dynamic soliton-mean flow interaction with non-convex flux.” <i>J. Fluid Mech.</i> 928(A21).

2022-05-04	Decreasing false-alarm rates in CNN-based solar flare prediction using SDO/HMI data	The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series	A hybrid two-stage machine-learning architecture that addresses the problem of excessive false positives (false alarms) in solar flare prediction systems is investigated. The first stage is a convolutional neural network (CNN) model based on the VGG-16 architecture that extracts features from a temporal stack of consecutive Solar Dynamics Observatory Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager magnetogram images to produce a flaring probability. The probability of flaring is added to a feature vector derived from the magnetograms to train an extremely randomized trees (ERT) model in the second stage to produce a binary deterministic prediction (flare/no-flare) in a 12 hr forecast window.

2022-07-07	Fourier continuation discontinuous Galerkin methods for linear hyperbolic problems	Communications on Applied Mathematics and Computation	Fourier continuation is an approach used to create periodic extensions of non-periodic functions in order to obtain highly-accurate Fourier expansions. These methods have been used in PDE-solvers and have demonstrated high-order convergence and spectrally accurate dispersion relations in numerical experiments. Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods are increasingly used for solving PDEs and, as all Galerkin formulations, come with a strong framework for proving stability and convergence. Here we propose the use of Fourier continuation in forming a new basis for the DG framework.	van der Sande, K. and Appelo, D. and Albin, N.
