excerpt: 'The interaction of localised solitary waves with large-scale, time-varying dispersive mean
flows subject to non-convex flux is studied in the framework of the modified Korteweg–de
Vries (mKdV) equation, a canonical model for internal gravity wave propagation and
potential vorticity fronts in stratified fluids. The effect of large amplitude, dynamically
evolving mean flows on the propagation of localised waves – essentially ‘soliton steering’
by the mean flow – is considered. A recent theoretical and experimental study of this
new type of dynamic soliton–mean flow interaction for convex flux has revealed two
scenarios where the soliton either transmits through the varying mean flow or remains
trapped inside it. In this paper, it is demonstrated that the presence of a non-convex cubic
hydrodynamic flux introduces significant modifications to the scenarios for transmission
and trapping. A reduced set of Whitham modulation equations is used to formulate
a general mathematical framework for soliton–mean flow interaction with non-convex
flux. Solitary wave trapping is stated in terms of crossing modulation characteristics. Numerical simulations of the mKdV equation agree with modulation theory predictions.
The mathematical framework developed is general, not restricted to completely integrable
equations like mKdV, enabling application beyond the mKdV setting to other fluid
dynamic contexts subject to non-convex flux such as strongly nonlinear internal wave
propagation that is prevalent in the ocean.'
