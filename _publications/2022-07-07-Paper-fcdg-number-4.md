excerpt: 'Fourier continuation is an approach used to create periodic extensions of non-periodic functions in order to obtain highly-accurate Fourier expansions. These methods have been used in PDE-solvers and have demonstrated high-order convergence and spectrally accurate dispersion relations in numerical experiments. Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods are increasingly used for solving PDEs and, as all Galerkin formulations, come with a strong framework for proving stability and convergence. Here we propose the use of Fourier continuation in forming a new basis for the DG framework.'

Fourier continuation is an approach used to create periodic extensions of non-periodic functions in order to obtain highly-accurate Fourier expansions. These methods have been used in PDE-solvers and have demonstrated high-order convergence and spectrally accurate dispersion relations in numerical experiments. Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods are increasingly used for solving PDEs and, as all Galerkin formulations, come with a strong framework for proving stability and convergence. Here we propose the use of Fourier continuation in forming a new basis for the DG framework.
